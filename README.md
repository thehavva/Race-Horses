# Race-Horses
This project is an indicator of horse racing. We take the maximum time and number of horses required to finish the system race track. Then we get the names of the horses. We visually show the starting line-up of the horses on the screen. Before the race starts, we choose which horse to bet on and how much to bet from the user. At the end of the race, the results are displayed both in text and visually. According to the results, whether we win or not is given to the screen. If we guessed correctly, we win double the stake, if we don't guess correctly, we lose 5x.
